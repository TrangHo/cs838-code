Speech by Milo Yiannopoulos Is Canceled Amid Protests at Berkeley

By CHRISTOPHER MELE

A speech by the divisive right-wing editor Milo Yiannopoulos at the <pos>University of California, Berkeley</pos>, was canceled on Wednesday night after demonstrators set fires and threw objects at buildings to protest his appearance.

The university announced the cancellation on Twitter around 9:15 p.m., about an hour after a section of the campus erupted in protest. There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries.

All buildings on campus were in a lockdown, and the university police said on Twitter that those on campus should ''shelter in place.''

Mr. Yiannopoulos, an editor at Breitbart News, is known for his gleeful attacks on political correctness that can sometimes veer into offensive and racially charged language.

Notably, he was barred from Twitter for inciting trolls to attack the ''Ghostbusters'' actress Leslie Jones.

His flamethrower approach has aroused a fierce backlash. His scheduled speech at <pos>U.C. Davis</pos> last month devolved into a tense standoff between protesters and the police. It was called off before it could begin over security concerns.

On Twitter, the Berkeley campus police described the episode on Wednesday night as ''major protest attacks'' and urged people to stay away. Crowds lingered despite police orders to disperse.

On Facebook, Mr. Yiannopoulos said he had been evacuated from the campus after ''violent left-wing protesters tore down barricades, lit fires, threw rocks and Roman candles at the windows and breached the ground floor of the building.''

He added, ''One thing we do know for sure: The Left is absolutely terrified of free speech and will do literally anything to shut it down.''

A portable high-intensity light, the kind used on construction sites, was set afire, according to an image on Twitter.
