Over the years, scientists have come up with a lot of ideas about why we sleep.

Some have argued that it’ a way to save energy. Others have suggested that slumber provides an opportunity to clear away the brain’ cellular waste. Still others have proposed that sleep simply forces animals to lie still, letting them hide from predators.
