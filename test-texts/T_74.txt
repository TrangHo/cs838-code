<pos>Georgetown University</pos> Plans Steps to Atone for Slave Past 2

More than a dozen universities — including <pos>Brown</pos>, <pos>Harvard</pos> and the <pos>University of Virginia</pos> — have publicly recognized their ties to slavery and the slave trade. But Craig Steven Wilder and Alfred L. Brophy, two historians who have studied universities and slavery, said they knew of none that had offered preferential status in admissions to the descendants of slaves.

Professor Wilder, of the <pos>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</pos>, said Dr. DeGioia’s plans to address <pos>Georgetown</pos>’s history go beyond any initiatives enacted by a university in the past 10 years.

“It goes farther than just about any institution,” he said. “I think it’s to <pos>Georgetown</pos>’s credit. It’s taking steps that a lot of universities have been reluctant to take.”

But whether the initiatives result in meaningful change remains to be seen, he said. Professor Wilder cautioned that the significance of the preferential status in admissions would rest heavily on the degree to which <pos>Georgetown</pos> invested in outreach to descendants, including identifying them, making sure they are aware of the benefit’s existence and actively recruiting them to the university.

“The question of how effective or meaningful this is going to be will only be answered over time,” Professor Wilder said.

Dr. DeGioia’s plan, which builds on the recommendations of the committee that he convened last year, represents the university’s first systematic effort to address its roots in slavery. <pos>Georgetown</pos>, which was founded and run by Jesuit priests in 1789, relied on the Jesuit plantations in Maryland — and the sale of produce and slaves — to finance its operations.
