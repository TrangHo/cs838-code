President Trump’ deeply suspicious view of Islam, shared by several key advisers, appears to be reshaping U.S. policies on law, order and immigration.

Speaking to a gathering of religious leaders in Washington, Mr. Trump brushed aside concerns about his handling of foreign allies, set off a feud with Arnold Schwarzenegger over TV ratings and pledged to “estroy” law restricting political speech by tax-exempt churches. Later, he unexpectedly shifted his stance on Israel, warning against more settlement construction.

Back Story

Super Bowl Sunday is approaching, and if you’e gearing up to watch the big game, you’e probably thinking about snacks. Which brings us to the potato chip and its exotic side.

Americans consumed an estimated 11.2 million pounds of chips during last year’ game. Plain old “lain”emains popular, but more daring varieties are available on American supermarket shelves, like dill pickle or crab.

And around the world, there are dozens of fascinating flavors.

In Britain, Walkers Crisps boast flavors like prawn cocktail, roast chicken and even Marmite, the ubiquitous spread made from yeast extract. Tyrrells has flavors like Angus beef and roast lamb.

Pringles have a variety of flavors, like salt and seaweed in the Philippines, consommén Japan, and Serrano ham in Mexico and parts of South America.

Canada pays tribute to a beloved restaurant chain’ signature savory condiment with Lay’ Chalet Sauce-flavored potato chips.

But perhaps the oddest, and least appealing, flavor was “ajun squirrel,” which was a finalist in a contest Walkers held in 2009.

Whatever flavor you prefer, thank Joe Murphy, an Irishman who in the ’0s pushed the chip industry to become tastier. His nickname, naturally, was “pud.”
