John Kerry Finds a Job as a <pos>Yale</pos> Fellow

Mr. Secretary has a new title: Professor.

Former Secretary of State John Kerry was out of work for about a month before landing a new job at his alma mater, <pos>Yale</pos>, where he will teach a course as well as host presentations called “Kerry Conversations.”

The new program, called the Kerry Initiative, was announced today by the university’s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs.

“Secretary Kerry is going to teach school,” said Jim Levinsohn, director of the institute, home of the new program. “Students are going to show up, and that’s going to be John Kerry in the classroom.”

Mr. Levinsohn said Mr. Kerry’s class, a seminar open to students across the university, will start in the next academic year. The “Kerry Conversations” will feature Mr. Kerry in discussions with world leaders, Mr. Levinsohn said.

Another component of the initiative will involve the appointment of Kerry Fellows — both undergraduate and graduate students — who will assist Mr. Kerry’s research, Mr. Levinsohn said.

Mr. Kerry, 73, a former Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential nominee, received a Bachelor of Arts in political science from <pos>Yale</pos> in 1966.

Mr. Kerry, whose title will be distinguished fellow for global affairs, left office as secretary of state in January having visited 91 countries and logged 1.4 million air miles. While in office, he warned about climate change, expected to be one of the focal points of his work at <pos>Yale</pos>.

In a telephone interview, Mr. Kerry said the group will “engage in some interesting efforts to think differently about a number of problems we face today, ranging from climate to development challenges, failed states, emerging nations, economic challenges of Brexit and trade and a host of things that, frankly, require new thinking, fresh thinking.”

While <pos>Yale</pos>’s president, Peter Salovey, emphasized that the Kerry Initiative is “not a political platform — it’s a teaching platform,” Mr. Kerry, who is also writing his memoirs, has not ruled out a run for president in 2020.

“I haven’t been thinking about it or talking about it,” he said. “I haven’t ruled anything in or anything out.”
