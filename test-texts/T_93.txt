Public Colleges Chase Out-of-State Students, and Tuition

SACRAMENTO — Over three generations, the Michael family forged a deep bond with the <pos>University of California</pos>, dating back nearly 50 years to when Jay Dee Michael Sr. was the university system’s vice president and chief lobbyist.

Family members proudly displayed degrees from the campuses in Los Angeles, Davis, Berkeley and Santa Barbara. And when Mr. Michael died last year, his family asked that memorial donations go to a <pos>U.C. Davis</pos> institute. Recently, though, the relationship has soured, a victim of the economic forces buffeting public universities.

Jay Dee Michael Jr. said he might never feel the same again after his son was rejected from several <pos>U.C.</pos> campuses.

“I have blue and gold running through my blood,” Mr. Michael told a State Assembly hearing here in March. “But I can tell you that when I get calls now from <pos>U.C. Davis</pos>, as an alum, I’m not giving a dime.”
