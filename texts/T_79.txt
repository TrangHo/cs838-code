Unions in the Ivory Tower

In a corrective action more than a decade in the making, the National Labor Relations Board ruled on Tuesday that graduate students who work as teaching and research assistants at private universities have the right to unionize.

The ruling reverses a misguided decision by the board in 2004, which held that graduate assistants at <pos>Brown University</pos> were primarily students, not employees, and thus had no standing to form a union. The new ruling, issued in response to a petition by graduate students at <pos>Columbia University</pos>, found graduate assistants to be employees if they are paid to do jobs that are overseen by the university, even if they have other relationships to the institution.

The new ruling also notes that nothing in federal labor law indicates that university employees are to be treated any differently than other workers when it comes to the right to organize. Yet the earlier ruling simply accepted the university assertions that unionization was incompatible with academic life because it would intrude on matters like academic freedom, the relationship between graduate students and professors, grading procedures and exam formats.

None of that has turned out to be true in the experience of public universities with graduate student unions. Some 35,000 teaching and research assistants across the country are currently in unions. The board pointed to research conducted at public universities, many of which have long been unionized under state laws. The studies found that unionization either had no impact on academic matters or had actually fostered improvements in university life.

The board also cited the experience of <pos>New York University</pos>, which voluntarily recognized a graduate-assistant union in 2013. Clauses in the contract between the assistants and the university sensibly separate issues of collective bargaining — including pay, hours, grievance procedures and other workplace conditions — from academic matters.

This week’s ruling allows graduate assistants to vote on whether to unionize, and if they do, for the students and the universities to bargain in good faith. <pos>Columbia</pos> has roughly 3,000 graduate assistants, as does <pos>Harvard</pos>, where graduate assistants are also expected to vote on forming a union.

There will be plenty to discuss between the students and the administrations. In recent decades, as tenure-track positions at universities have declined precipitously, teaching and research — the mainstay of universities — have increasingly been taken up by adjunct faculty members and graduate assistants, without commensurate increase in pay, status or career opportunities. On many campuses, teaching and research assistants are essentially low-paid, white-collar workers, typically earning around $30,000 a year, most of whom will never get tenure-track positions.

The question going forward is the extent to which those new unions will help improve working conditions in academic life.
