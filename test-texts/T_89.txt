<pos>Yale</pos> Drops Case Against Worker Who Smashed Window Depicting Slaves

As <pos>Yale</pos> continues to debate the legacy of John C. Calhoun, an alumnus and leading 19th-century politician and slaveholder for whom one of its residential colleges is named, the university said on Tuesday that it would not press charges in the case of a black dining hall worker who smashed a stained-glass panel depicting slaves carrying cotton.

The <pos>Yale</pos> police initially arrested the worker, Corey Menafee, 38, after he climbed on top of a table in the <pos>Calhoun College</pos> dining hall and smashed the window, one of several related to Calhoun and to slavery, with a broom handle.

The episode, which took place in mid-June but only recently garnered widespread attention, was first reported by The New Haven Independent.

“No employee should be subject to coming to work and seeing slave portraits on a daily basis,” Mr. Menafee told a police officer, according to the Yale Police Department’s incident report.
