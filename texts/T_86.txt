<pos>M.I.T.</pos>, <pos>N.Y.U.</pos> and <pos>Yale</pos> Are Sued Over Retirement Plan Fees

Three prominent universities were sued on Tuesday, accused of allowing their employees to be charged excessive fees on their retirement savings.

The universities — the <pos>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</pos>, <pos>New York University</pos> and <pos>Yale</pos> — each have retirement plans holding more than $3 billion in assets and are being individually sued by a number of their employees in cases seeking class-action status.

The lawyer representing the three groups of plaintiffs, Jerome J. Schlichter, is a pioneer in retirement plan litigation. Over the last decade, he has filed more than 20 lawsuits on behalf of workers in 401(k) retirement plans and has been widely credited with lowering plan fees across corporate America.

With the suits filed in federal courts on Tuesday, the focus has turned to a lesser-known corner of the retirement savings market, 403(b) plans, which are named for a section of the tax code. The accounts are similar to 401(k) plans, but are offered by public schools and nonprofit institutions like universities and hospitals.

The complaints allege that the universities, as the plan sponsors, failed to monitor excessive fees paid to administer the plans and did not replace more expensive, poor-performing investments with cheaper ones. Had the plans eliminated their long lists of investment options and used their bargaining power to cut costs, the complaints argue, participants could have collectively saved tens of millions of dollars.

“It is important for retirees and employees of universities to have the same rights and ability to build their retirement assets as employees of for-profit companies,” said Mr. Schlichter, a founding partner of Schlichter Bogard & Denton in St. Louis. “They shouldn’t be penalized.”

In a statement, <pos>New York University</pos> said that it took the welfare of its faculty and employees seriously, including a dignified retirement. “The retirement plans offered to them are chosen and administered carefully and prudently. We will litigate this case vigorously and expect to prevail,” said John Beckman, a university spokesman.
