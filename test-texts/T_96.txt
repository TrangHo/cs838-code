Supreme Court Decision on Affirmative Action Cheered by College Admissions Experts

College admissions experts breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday when the Supreme Court upheld a <pos>University of Texas</pos> admissions plan that allows race and ethnicity to be considered as one of many factors in admission.

“I think there are going to be some parties tonight in high school counseling offices and in college admissions offices,” said Phil Trout, the president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling and a college counselor at Minnetonka High School outside Minneapolis. “‘Sigh of relief’ is not strong enough.”

In its ruling, the Supreme Court noted that the Texas plan — which automatically grants admission to roughly the top 10 percent of students across the state, then uses race as one of many factors in considering the rest — was unique and very much a product of Texas politics, law and demographics.

But what was encouraging about the court decision, experts said, was that in affirming the value of diversity, including race and ethnicity, in higher education, the court recognized that there was not one, immutable way of defining and achieving it.

“It’s a terrific outcome,” said Peter McDonough, the vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education. “I think today’s decision is about deference. It’s not about dictating. I think it’s about the continuing recognition that our country’s campuses are laboratories for experimentation, and that the formula for diversity does remain elusive. It changes over time, and it is impacted by context.”

Mr. McDonough echoed a critical part of the Supreme Court opinion that described public universities as “laboratories for experimentation” and called on the <pos>University of Texas at Austin</pos> “to scrutinize the fairness of its admissions program; to assess whether changing demographics have undermined the need for a race-conscious policy; and to identify the effects, both positive and negative, of the affirmative-action measures it deems necessary.”

The decision was made on fairly narrow legal grounds and does not establish any bold new policy, said David Hawkins, the executive director for education content and policy of the National Association for College Admission Counseling. “I don’t expect to see a resounding clarion call for further investment in the use of race and ethnicity as an admissions tool,” he said.

Mr. Hawkins said he expected colleges to react by heeding the court’s call to be introspective — to “engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection” — about how they achieved diversity.
