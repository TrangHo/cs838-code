A Liberal Wanted to Agitate Ole Miss From Inside. He’s Succeeding.

OXFORD, Miss. — Allen Coon, perhaps the most reviled student at the <pos>University of Mississippi</pos>, was walking to his public policy class at the Trent Lott Leadership Institute on a recent weekday morning, sporting a red faux Trump cap emblazoned with the message MAKE AMERICA NATIVE AGAIN.

Mr. Coon, 21, a white man from Petal, Miss., had just cut his shoulder-length hair. It had been his visual signature on a conservative campus where the sight of a man with long hair retains some power to provoke. It had also inspired his black friends to refer to him, playfully and semi-sarcastically, as White Jesus.

Mr. Coon is aware that black people aren’t looking for a white savior. And he is acutely aware that his surname, which doubles as a racial slur, can teeter like an unexploded bomb on the lips of every Mississippian who dares to mutter it.

Yet none of that impeded Mr. Coon’s transformation into a full-blown campus celebrity in October 2015, when he helped lead the student movement that brought the Confederate-themed state flag down from the university’s main flagpole. The episode transformed Mr. Coon into a kind of stock campus character: Student agitator. Hero and villain. Subject of catcalls. Subject of memes. Someone many students loathe and many others deeply admire.
