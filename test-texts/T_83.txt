Employees Sue Four More Universities Over Retirement Plan Fees

More leading universities have been sued on claims that their retirement plans charged employees excessive fees, following a series of similar suits filed earlier this week.

In the latest round, complaints were filed in various federal courts on behalf of employees at <pos>Duke</pos>, <pos>Johns Hopkins</pos>, the <pos>University of Pennsylvania</pos> and <pos>Vanderbilt</pos>. The earlier lawsuits were filed against the <pos>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</pos>, <pos>New York University</pos> and <pos>Yale</pos> on Tuesday. All of the complaints seek class-action status.

Jerome J. Schlichter, a lawyer well known for his pioneering litigation in the world of 401(k) retirement plans, is representing the plaintiffs. But with these suits, the spotlight has shifted to a more obscure corner of the retirement savings market, 403(b) plans, which are similar to 401(k) plans but are typically offered by public schools and nonprofit institutions like universities and hospitals.

All of the suits, including the latest four, share similar overarching themes: The universities all used more than one provider, known as a record keeper, to operate their plans and perform the administrative services to keep them running. Had they consolidated to one provider, the plaintiffs claim, they could have used their bargaining power to negotiate much lower fees. Instead, the suits allege, the plans overpaid millions of dollars each year.

The complaints also argue that the plans sponsored by the universities offered far too many investment options — many of which were too expensive — when cheaper alternatives were available. It also argued that the long lists of investments served only to confuse investors.

For instance, <pos>Duke</pos>, which had $4.7 billion in assets held by nearly 38,000 participants at the end of 2014, used four providers (TIAA, Vanguard, Fidelity and Valic), offering 400 investment choices.
