Public Colleges Chase Out-of-State Students, and Tuition

‘Shifting the Culture’

Elliot Spillers, from Pelham, Ala., was student body president at the <pos>University of Alabama</pos> last year — the first black student in 40 years to have held that position. He said he doubted he would have been elected if the student body, which is mostly white, had been homegrown. The university’s enrollment is now more than half out-of-staters.

“It’s definitely shifting the culture here on campus, which is a positive thing,” Mr. Spillers said, echoing the views of many students.

Others see a less positive side to the change.

Of the out-of-state undergraduates at Alabama’s Tuscaloosa campus, more than 3,000 receive merit aid in the form of free or discounted tuition — an average of $19,000 per student. In 2015, the university gave $100 million in merit aid.

Mr. Burd, of the New America Foundation, wonders if that money could be better used to help needy students, particularly in a state with a poverty rate among the highest in the country. In essence, he said, some colleges have adopted the enrollment tactics of private colleges to increase revenues and enhance prestige.

Devin Thompson of St. Paul, Minn., had a near-perfect SAT score and realized he could save $200,000 over four years by not attending a private college in Virgina and instead accepting the free tuition offered by Alabama, automatic to anyone with his record. The son of college professors, he will be attending this fall.

By enrolling Mr. Thompson, Alabama will elevate its average SAT score, one of the metrics used in the U.S. News and World Report rankings. That, in turn, education experts say, will attract other affluent students, many of whom will get smaller merit packages from Alabama — just enough to make the college enticing compared with its peers.

Meanwhile, the number of entering freshmen from Alabama high schools has declined steadily, from 3,122 in 2009 to 2,458 in 2015, records show. University officials say the acceptance rate for those students — 63 percent — has remained the same.

About half a mile away and just across the railroad tracks from the <pos>University of Alabama</pos>’s manicured campus sits the mostly black Central High School.

Few Central High students attend the <pos>University of Alabama</pos>. Ernestine Tucker, a Tuscaloosa school board member, wonders whether the university is working hard enough to recruit them.

“You would think their first priority would be the local students,” Ms. Tucker said.

Mr. Michael, whose son attends the <pos>University of Washington</pos>, was one of thousands of California residents who complained about admissions practices at <pos>U.C.</pos> From 2010 to 2014, the number of California residents enrolled declined by 1 percent, or 2,200 students, while nonresidents increased by 82 percent, or 18,000 students, the audit found. In 2015, nonresident students paid $37,000, compared with $12,240 for in-state.

“Over the past several years, the university has failed to put the needs of residents first,” the audit said.

One of those residents was Priyanka Krishnamurthi, a math wiz from Saratoga with a near-perfect SAT score. She ended up at Yale after being turned down by her desired program at Berkeley.

In debating a bill in June over enrollment at the <pos>University of California</pos>, Assemblywoman Cheryl Brown told colleagues about her granddaughter, who recently graduated from high school in Sacramento, but did not bother to apply to <pos>U.C.</pos> schools. That is because a college admissions adviser told her she would be a good candidate only if she were from out of state.

To Mr. Michael’s way of thinking, when it came to his son, the <pos>University of California</pos> had reneged on an unwritten contract.

“In my case, three generations of Michaels have supported and funding the <pos>U.C.</pos>, and the same is true for my wife’s family,” he said. “And then, when it comes time for our children to go, there’s no room.”
