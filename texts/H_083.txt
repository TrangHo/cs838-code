By SEAN ALFANO

(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’ the sign-up.)

Good morning.

Here’ what you need to know:

•ifts and bonds with foreign leaders.

Diplomatic relations between the U.S. and its longtime ally Australia could be fraying after President Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had a contentious phone call.

Mr. Turnbull pressed Mr. Trump to honor an agreement to accept 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. The American president called it a “umb deal.”

But Mr. Trump’ brand of nationalism is likely to be better received elsewhere. Leaders in Egypt, the Philippines, Russia and Turkey are among those who hope for a U.S. less inclined to criticize their human rights records.

• iew of Islam influences policy .

During his campaign, Mr. Trump embraced a deep suspicion of Islam that former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had shunned.

Now, that vision is moving to the center of American decision-making on security and law.

Separately, we look at questions surrounding the first counterterrorism operation in the Trump administration, a raid in Yemen on Sunday against a Qaeda collaborator. An American commando was killed, and several civilians may also have died, the Pentagon said.

• vow to overturn law banning political activity by churches.

Mr. Trump said he would “otally destroy” the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits churches from openly endorsing or campaigning for candidates.

Those that do risk losing their tax-exempt status. Repealing the law would require approval by Congress

•rump’ education pick may be in peril.

Two Republican senators said they would join Democrats in voting against Betsy DeVos, the nominee for education secretary. Vice President Mike Pence could still break a tie to win her confirmation.

On Wednesday, Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, was confirmed as secretary of state. And Mr. Trump advised Republican senators to consider going “nuclear”y skipping the 60-vote threshold needed to confirm Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, his choice for the Supreme Court.

•sraeli settlement plans kick into high gear.

Israel has approved thousands more housing units in the occupied West Bank and, for the first time in years, has called for the establishment of a new settlement there.

On Wednesday, settlers living in an unauthorized outpost clashed with the police, who had been sent to evacuate about 40 families.

•iolence breaks out on a campus..

A speech by the divisive Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos at the <pos>University of California, Berkeley</pos>, was canceled Wednesday night after demonstrators set fires and threw objects.

•elaware prison standoff ends.

A corrections worker taken hostage by inmates was found dead this morning, a day after the standoff began. A second worker was found alive after the state police stormed a building at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Facility.

Business

•Facebook scored a victory and suffered a loss. The social media company said sales totaled $8.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, up 51 percent from a year earlier.

But its Oculus branch lost a $500 million lawsuit involving copyright infringement.

•ew Zealand has released documents tied to its approval of Peter Thiel’ 2011 application for citizenship.

Mr. Thiel, a billionaire tech investor and adviser to Mr. Trump, wrote that the country shared his view of “he future”ut that he did not intend to live there —aising questions about the New Zealand government’ motivation.

•t’ tax season in the U.S., and IBM’ Watson is being deployed by H&R Blockas a virtual assistant.

Noteworthy

• refugee’ story.

“his country took me and my family in when we were at one of the lowest points of our lives and returned to me a feeling I had lost: that of being safe.”

That’ Helene Cooper, a Washington reporter for The Times, describing her family’ harrowing effort to reach the U.S. from Liberia in 1980.

•n memoriam.

Bharati Mukherjee, 76, an Indian-born American writer who explored the internal clashes of her immigrant characters in the award-winning collection “he Middleman and Other Stories”nd in novels like “asmine.”

And Lennart Nilsson, a Swedish photographer whose micro-cameras bared some of life’ breathtaking moments —ost memorably a human embryo’ maturation. He was 94.

Back Story

Does it matter whether a groundhog knows when spring will arrive?

Whether or not Punxsutawney Phil sees a shadow today in Pennsylvania, the vernal equinox is less than seven weeks away. While Groundhog Day is popular in the U.S., there are harbingers of the season elsewhere that don’ involve a rodent.

The Bosnian tradition of Cimburijada, also known as the Festival of Scrambled Eggs, celebrates the first day of spring with a supersize breakfast. In Alaska, the Nenana Ice Classic is a statewide contest with a six-figure jackpot for correctly guessing when the Nenana River’ ice will break —ometime between mid-April and mid-May is typical.

But there’ a celebration in the Royal Burgh of Lanark, Scotland, that stands apart for its unique name: Whuppity Scoorie.

On every first of March, children swing balls of paper on a string tied around their heads while running three times around the town’ church bell.

Whuppity Scoorie’ origins are unclear, but some view it as a pagan festival meant to drive out evil and welcome spring. The townspeople don’ seem to mind the ambiguity.

“hat’ the great thing about it,” longtime resident once said. “ou make up your own myth.”

Remy Tumin contributed reporting.
