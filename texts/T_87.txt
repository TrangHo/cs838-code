A Prized Stettheimer Painting, Sold Under the Radar by a University

When <pos>Fisk University</pos>, the historically black school in Nashville, tried to sell two paintings several years ago from its storied Alfred Stieglitz art collection, a firestorm erupted. The proposed sale violated conditions of the gift of the collection from Stieglitz’s widow, Georgia O’Keeffe, according to her foundation.

A drawn-out legal challenge ended in a compromise in 2012 that allowed <pos>Fisk</pos> to share its collection with Crystal Bridges, the Arkansas museum founded by Alice Walton, the Walmart heiress, bringing the struggling university an infusion of $30 million.

But what was not revealed at the time, and has only recently come to light, is that before the agreement was completed — and with the debate over the future of <pos>Fisk</pos> itself swirling around her — Hazel O’Leary, then the university’s president, on behalf of the school quietly sold off two other paintings owned by <pos>Fisk</pos>.

The institution was “under duress,” said Patrick Albano of Aaron Galleries, an art dealer from Illinois whom Ms. O’Leary asked to broker the sale.

One painting was Florine Stettheimer’s exuberantly detailed “Asbury Park South.” Its sale represented the first time a major work by Stettheimer, the beloved New York modernist artist and salon hostess, had come on the market in 20 years.

According to Mr. Albano, <pos>Fisk</pos> decided to sell work by Stettheimer and the painter and illustrator Rockwell Kent, which had been donated to the university with “no strings attached.”

Another dealer ultimately bought the Stettheimer painting, offering it for sale at the Armory Show in New York in 2012. When Michael Rosenfeld, a gallery owner, saw “Asbury Park South,” halfway out of a crate, “I literally got on my knees, and said to the person in the booth, ‘I have to have this painting,’” he recalled. “It was virtually impossible to own a major painting” by Stettheimer, he added. Mr. Rosenfeld scooped it up for an undisclosed amount.

<pos>Fisk</pos>’s under-the-radar sale of the Stettheimer highlights the minefield institutions must navigate when they use proceeds from art, whether to pay expenses or, in recent years, to try to finance costly expansions. At the same time, the sale reveals what can happen when an artist — even one as critically revered as Stettheimer — fails to secure her legacy.

“Shame on them,” said Lyndel King, director of the Weisman Museum at the <pos>University of Minnesota</pos> and a chairwoman of the Task Force for the Protection of University Collections, referring to Fisk’s actions. “It’s very much against the ethics of our profession.”
