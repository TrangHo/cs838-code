Arguing for a Judge Today, and Before Him Tomorrow

By LIZ SPAYD

Neal K. Katyal was for a time the top lawyer in the Obama administration. As acting solicitor general, he represented the government before the Supreme Court. He is no conservative, and says he is disappointed that the latest nominee to the court is from the White House of President Donald Trump.

Yet in the opinion pages of The New York Times on Tuesday, Katyal made a forceful case for Trump’ pick to the high court, Judge Neil Gorsuch. Katyal called the nominee a man of principle who will uphold the rule of law, and “ring a sense of fairness and decency to the job, and a temperament that suits the nation’ highest court.”

The author says he knows this because he has seen Gorsuch in action, both in court and through a federal rules committee on which they both serve. What Katyal did not mention —nd the Op-Ed page did not disclose in his bio —s that he has cases pending before the Supreme Court.

Katyal was identified as a former solicitor general, a law professor at <pos>Georgetown University</pos> and a private litigator at the law firm Hogan Lovells. But in that last role he represents the giant drug manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb, Indian tribes and numerous other clients with cases before the court.

Some readers would have liked to know more about Katyal’ background.

Here’ one email from Mithra Busler of Atlantic Highlands, N.J.

The opinion piece by Neal Katyal, “hy Liberals Should Back Neil Gorsuch,”ails to disclose the many conflicts of interest that plague Mr. Katyal’ credibility as an evenhanded commentator. He is allowed to wave his position as acting solicitor general in the Obama administration as liberal bona fides but fails to mention that his current work involves representing large corporate interests in front of the Supreme Court. At least two of these cases would almost certainly benefit from the confirmation of the pro-corporation Gorsuch.

I took this concern to both Op-Ed page and to Katyal himself.

Jim Dao, the Op-Ed editor, said the editors had not been aware of Katyal’ cases before the court. Writers are required to disclose potential conflicts, he said, but the process got rushed in this case. “ditors do try to ask writers directly,”e said. “n tight deadlines —nd the Katyal piece was done on tight deadline —he question doesn’ always get asked. So I don’ blame the writer or the editor in this case.”

When I reached out to Katyal, he said he had not received such a disclosure request and had not had a conversation about potential conflicts. He also thought it was obvious to The Times that as a lawyer whose practice often brings him to the Supreme Court, he would have a case before it.

More critically, Katyal said, it is common for Supreme Court lawyers not to mention litigation they have pending before the court when writing an opinion piece about a nominee or speaking to a reporter. Here’ his response to me in full:

It is a matter of public record that I am a Supreme Court lawyer and naturally will have matters pending before that court. It is quite common for Supreme Court lawyers to express views on nominees without explicitly mentioning their pending cases, as it goes without saying that a Supreme Court practitioner practices before the court. When many Supreme Court lawyers (including former solicitors general) wrote op-eds and publicly praised Judge Garland during his nomination, their pending cases were not mentioned either. The same thing happened with the chief justice’ and Justice Kagan’ confirmations; The New York Times is in good company. Moreover, it would be completely speculative to presume what a nominee might do as a justice in any particular case. That is especially true in light of my diverse caseload at the Court, which includes a variety of pending matters that might appeal to different judicial ideologies, or that have no clear ideological angle at all. All of that is presumably why your editors did not include such information in my article.

The problem is that the piece did not note that Katyal is among the elite lawyers who argue before the high court. That lack of disclosure may leave Katyal open to criticism, not only from readers but from others looking to challenge his motives. (The liberal website ThinkProgress criticized The Times’ failure to disclose his cases on Wednesday.)

I’ not suggesting Katyal is currying favor with a man who is almost certainly going to be on the court. I seriously doubt that he is. Plus, given the range of his clients, some might benefit and others not if Gorsuch is even on the bench when their cases come up. But The Times opens itself up to that criticism by failing to simply tell the readers more about who he is.

Katyal’ piece falls into an appealing category for an op-ed editor: a partisan who breaks ranks to support the opposition.. Whenever that happens, the author of the piece is bound to endure scrutiny by those who feel betrayed. Shouldn’ The Times err on the side of disclosure? It doesn’ need to be in heavy-handed language that implies a grave conflict.

I’ not suggesting that The Times should have listed every case Katyal has before the court. But at minimum, readers in this case deserve to know that he is a Supreme Court litigator with cases before the court. Let the readers decide if that matters, or indeed whether it might even enhance the author’ expertise.
