He Said, She Said: Gender-Bending the Presidential Debates

By ALEXIS SOLOSKI 


He smiled. She sniffed. He sat. She stalked. He called her a ''puppet.'' She called him a ''nasty man.'' These were the 2016 presidential debates as re-enacted in Greenwich Village over the weekend.

At the Provincetown Playhouse on Saturday, professors from <pos>New York University</pos>, the <pos>hode Island School of Design</pos> and the French business school Insead twice presented ''Her Opponent,'' a free 35-minute performance composed of excerpts from the three presidential debates with a significant twist in the casting: Donald J. Trump was played by a woman, Rachel Tuggle Whorton, a Ph.D. candidate and adjunct instructor at N.Y.U. Hillary Clinton was played by a man, Daryl Embry, another adjunct instructor. To complete the gender inversion, the candidates were given new names, Brenda King in place of Mr. Trump, Jonathan Gordon for Ms. Clinton.

Drawing on the techniques of documentary theater, as practiced by the likes of Anna Deavere Smith, these actors not only studied the words of the candidates but also the gestures, posture, tempo and vocal intonation that each used. As Andy Wagner, the actor playing the moderator explained, the creators wanted to see if gender-inverted casting would ''cause people to revisit their own personal biases and develop insights or a different perspective.''

Using a theatrical performance to deconstruct responses to a months-old debate performance seems like another corridor in the hall of fun-house mirrors that is coming to define the Trump presidency, in which facts are countered with alternative facts, rogue social media accounts replace those that are muzzled and Mr. Trump as president-elect can take to Twitter to compare his cabinet selection process to reality TV or to carp about his impersonation on ''Saturday Night Live.''

Certainly, creating ''Her Opponent'' has been somewhat unnerving for those involved. ''We were dealing with a section on border control and immigration and now saying those words and seeing what's happening with that is really heavy and frustrating and horrifying,'' Ms. Whorton said.

Yet, according to many in the audience who spoke at a postshow talk-back, the cross-gender casting offered just enough remove to help them think through how they might have understood the debates had they not strongly preferred one candidate. ''It gives you a distance to actually reason,'' said Maria Guadalupe, a professor at Insead who first proposed the project.

At the playhouse, the stage was sparsely decorated with two lecterns and two monitors. The atmosphere among the standing-room-only crowd, which appeared mostly drawn from academic circles, was convivial, but also a little anxious. Most of the people there had watched the debates assuming that Ms. Clinton couldn't lose. This time they watched trying to figure out how Mr. Trump could have won. Interviews with cast members and comments from the postshow discussion suggested that they'd found some answers.

Her Smile (Performed by Him)

In the first debate, Mr. Embry, as Jonathan Gordon, smiled. And smiled. And smiled some more. If you were sympathetic, it was a knowing smile, an inclusive smile, a ''let's not stoop to that level, but can you believe this'' smile. If you were less approving, the tightly controlled smile could be seen as supercilious.

''Is it patronizing? Is it condescending?'' Mr. Embry, speaking before the performance, wondered. ''You see her filtering what she wants to say, biting back a reaction and then going in a much more polished, dignified way.''

A woman at the talk-back described that constant smile as ''really punchable.''

The Attacks

In the second debate, Ms. Whorton, as Brenda King, continually attacked. A question about taxes became a protest about why nothing had been done to close tax loopholes, then abruptly skittered into a condemnation of President Obama's actions in the Middle East.

Mr. Embry, reciting Ms. Clinton's lines, also attacked, but not as viciously nor as tenaciously. He offered a rushed pr√©is of a tax plan, corrected fact errors and detailed her accomplishments, responses that may not have stuck in the mind as fixedly as Mr. Trump's barbs or his jokes, like a refusal to name Ms. Clinton's donors: ''I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous. So we won't make them famous.''

''I was struck by the strength of the technique of the Brenda King character,'' said a man in the audience, speaking after the show. ''Attack. Consistently attack. Never stop attacking.''

Said a woman, ''When she was attacking, I had so much respect for her and her level of confidence.''

Bad Behavior

Excerpts from the third debate skipped several of the flash points -- the ''bad hombres,'' Mr. Trump's refusal to agree to honor the election results. But as performed by the actors, that debate did include name-calling, in which Jonathan Gordon referred to Brenda King as a likely puppet of Vladimir V. Putin. ''You're the puppet,'' she shot back, schoolyard-style.

The Gordon character did not interrupt nearly as frequently nor did he sidetrack the questions. Brenda King's discourteous behavior ruffled the moderator. ''I'm not a potted plant here,'' he snapped. But it also helped her undermine Gordon's rhetoric.

A woman who had supported Ms. Clinton sounded pained at the talk-back as she described her reaction to the Jonathan Gordon character. ''I felt that he was weak and I felt that I didn't really like him,'' she said.

And Joe Salvatore, an N.Y.U. professor and one of the project's creators, reflected on what he'd learned about Mr. Trump. ''At the time of the debates, I dismissed him as awkward, unskilled, untrained,'' he wrote in an email message. ''Now I'm not so sure that I would do that.''
