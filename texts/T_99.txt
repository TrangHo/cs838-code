At <pos>Vassar</pos>, a Focus on Diversity and Affordability in Higher Education

When Catharine Bond Hill walked the campus of <pos>Williams College</pos> as an undergraduate in the mid-1970s, the “whiteness” of the campus was apparent.

“It was certainly clear that there weren’t a lot of students of color there,” said Ms. Hill, who graduated from Williams, a liberal arts college in Williamstown, Mass., in 1976.

“I was well aware that I was with other kids who had a fairly privileged upbringing,” she said. “I do remember running into kids on the Williams campus back then who didn’t have a car parked in the lot; but that was unusual.”

For Ms. Hill, the president of <pos>Vassar College</pos> in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., that initial awareness planted the seeds of what would become her signature causes: socioeconomic diversity and affordability in higher education. It became her life’s work and the issue she was most focused on as she reflected on her career during an interview in the century-old Yale Club in Midtown Manhattan.Ms. Hill, 62, recently announced that she would step down from the presidency of <pos>Vassar</pos> next year.

Since she took over a decade ago, the student body of 2,450 has become the most diverse it has been since the college was founded in 1861.

Last year, the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation awarded <pos>Vassar</pos> its inaugural $1 million Cooke Prize for Equity in Educational Excellence for success in attracting and graduating low-income students.

<pos>Vassar</pos> has more than doubled the number of its low-income students during Ms. Hill’s tenure. The college’s financial aid budget has more than doubled to over $60 million; about 60 percent of current students receive some scholarship aid. Nearly a quarter of <pos>Vassar</pos>’s current first-year students are eligible for a Pell grant, which is available to students whose annual family income is $40,000 or less.

The percentage of American students of color has risen to 33 percent from 20 percent. And <pos>Vassar</pos> has gone from having few first-generation college students to enrolling from 75 to 100 (out of about 660) in recent freshman classes.

Elijah Mondesir, 21, a resident of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, who graduated from <pos>Vassar</pos> this spring, was one of them.
