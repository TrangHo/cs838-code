Public Colleges Chase Out-of-State Students, and Tuition 2

William Deary, who has made a fortune in the home health care business in Jackson, Mich., put himself through <pos>Michigan State</pos> by working nights in a door factory, making $28 an hour. Since then, high-paying hourly jobs have disappeared in Michigan, but tuition at <pos>Michigan State</pos> has risen sharply, Mr. Deary said, so much so that the university has become out of reach for many students.

It is part of the impetus for his first political campaign — for <pos>Michigan State</pos>’s board. He is also concerned that out-of-state and foreign students are squeezing out Michiganders.

“Our sons and daughters should come first,” Mr. Deary’s campaign literature urges.

<pos>Michigan State</pos>’s enrollment of about 50,000 includes 7,568 international students, placing it in the top 10 colleges for foreign student enrollment.

At the nearby <pos>University of Michigan</pos>, the student body of 43,625 is nearly 37 percent out-of-staters and nearly 14 percent international students. The New York Times reported in 2004 that more freshmen at the Ann Arbor campus came from families with annual income of $200,000 or more than from families with less than the median national income of $53,000.

The university has pointed out that its admissions rate for Michigan students is higher than for out-of-staters.

In Massachusetts, out-of-state enrollment has increased by nearly 85 percent at <pos>University of Massachusetts</pos> campuses since 2008, while in-state enrollment grew by only 19 percent, said a recent critical report by the Pioneer Institute, a Massachusetts think tank. <pos>UMass</pos> officials responded denying that in-state students had been adversely affected.

At the <pos>University of Wisconsin</pos>’s flagship campus in Madison, officials last fall lifted a cap on the enrollment of out-of-staters. The Wisconsin student newspaper, The Badger Herald, predicted that the university would transform into a bourgeois playground for wealthy Chicagoans, who can afford the luxury private dormitories near campus.
