Employees Sue Four More Universities Over Retirement Plan Fees 2

Beth Fortune, <pos>Vanderbilt</pos>’s vice chancellor for public affairs, said that the university had not yet been served with the complaint and needed more time to respond.

<pos>Johns Hopkins</pos>, with $4.3 billion in assets, offered more than 440 funds from its plan’s five record keepers. In January, it reduced the number to three; the complaint argues that the changes did not go far enough.

A spokeswoman said the university offers its employees “a generous and carefully managed benefits program, including for retirement,” and is in the process of reviewing the lawsuit.

A spokeswoman for the <pos>University of Pennsylvania</pos>, with $3.8 billion in assets at year-end 2014, said it employed a rigorous process to review all investment options, and ensured they were administered with the highest degree of care and prudence; she said the university planned to defend itself vigorously.
