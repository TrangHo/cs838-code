Off to College? Maybe These Devices Should Go Along

WHEN Vanessa Arreola, 18, starts her freshman year at <pos>Stanford University</pos> this fall, the top item on her back-to-school wish list is a MacBook Pro.

She said she wouldn’t consider a tablet because she prefers a traditional keyboard. She relies on apps like Google Docs for documents and Google Slides for presentations, which are available through a web browser.

“A tablet is just like your cellphone, but bigger,” she said. “I don’t see a point of getting a tablet.”

But Claire Ashcroft, 19, who studies public health at <pos>Brigham Young University in Idaho</pos>, said the opposite. Half of her textbooks are digitized, and she uses apps like Microsoft Excel and Word — so her ideal school device would be a Windows machine with a touch screen, like a Microsoft Surface tablet.
