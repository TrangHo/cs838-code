•r. Trump’ unpredictable style and early international moves, including a deadly raid in Yemen and a possible rift with Australia, will most likely top the agenda of a summit meeting of European leaders in Malta today.

Another key issue will be efforts to curb human trafficking across the Mediterranean and to coordinate humanitarian relief for migrants. Foreshadowing today’ talks, Italy pledged to support Libya’ Coast Guard in a deal reached yesterday. The U.S., meanwhile, suspended a decade-old program to resettle a small number of the refugees arriving in Malta.

Back Story

Super Bowl Sunday is approaching, and if you’e gearing up to watch the big game, you’e probably thinking about snacks. Which brings us to the potato chip and its exotic side.

Americans consumed an estimated 11.2 million pounds of chips during last year’ game. Plain old “lain”emains popular, but more daring varieties, like dill pickle or crab, are available on American supermarket shelves.

And around the world, there are dozens of fascinating flavors.

In Britain, Walkers Crisps have flavors like prawn cocktail, roast chicken and even Marmite, the ubiquitous spread made from yeast extract. Tyrrells has flavors like Angus beef and roast lamb.

Pringles have a variety of flavors, like salt and seaweed in the Philippines, consommén Japan, and Serrano ham in Mexico and parts of South America.

Canada pays tribute to a beloved restaurant chain’ signature savory condiment with Lay’ Chalet Sauce-flavored potato chips.

But perhaps the oddest, and least appealing, flavor was “Cajun squirrel,”hich was a finalist in a contest that Walkers held in 2009.

Whatever flavor you prefer, thank Joe Murphy, an Irishman who in the ’0s pushed the chip industry to become tastier. His nickname, naturally, was “pud.”
