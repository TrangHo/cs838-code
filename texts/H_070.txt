An article on Jan. 6 about Japan's new wave of ''genderless'' young men, who are developing a public identity and a career out of a new androgynous style, gave an outdated professional affiliation for Junko Mitsuhashi, who suggested that the young men are using fashion to challenge the social order, and misstated her former title. She is an adjunct lecturer in gender studies at <pos>Meiji University</pos>; she is no longer affiliated with <pos>Chuo University</pos>. At <pos>Chuo</pos>, she was a visiting researcher and lecturer, not a professor of gender studies.
