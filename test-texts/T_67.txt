<pos>L.I.U.-Brooklyn</pos> Locks Out Professors Amid Contract Dispute

Classes will start on Wednesday at <pos>Long Island University-Brooklyn</pos> without key participants: The professors.

After failing to reach an agreement on a new faculty union contract, which expired on Aug. 31, the university’s administration then locked faculty members out of their offices and their email accounts and canceled their health insurance over the Labor Day weekend.

Those who teach at the Downtown Brooklyn campus, which serves many black, Hispanic and immigrant students, said the lockout was an unprecedented move intended to weaken the union, the Long Island University Faculty Federation, which is part of the American Federation of Teachers.

“That’s never happened before in the history of <pos>L.I.U.</pos> to my knowledge, or in the history of higher education,” said Jessica Rosenberg, a professor of social work and the president of the faculty federation, which represents about 230 full-time faculty members and several hundred adjunct professors.

On Tuesday, administrators for <pos>L.I.U. Brooklyn</pos> said that the lockout was a pre-emptive move, given the faculty’s history in negotiations. “The last five out of six contracts, the faculty has gone on strike, and they have created chaos and virtually shut down the institution at the start of classes,” said Gale Stevens Haynes, a vice president and university counsel. The faculty went on strike in 2011 for five days.
