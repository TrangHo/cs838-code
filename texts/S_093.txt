The word coy has appeared in 131 New York Times articles in the past year, including on Jan. 8 in “Colleges Swear by Football Knee Braces. Not All Players and Experts Do,”y Sam Borden:

Bracing is not so widespread in the N.F.L., in part because the collective bargaining agreement makes it more difficult for teams to impose blanket equipment requirements. Some teams, like the New England Patriots and the Dallas Cowboys, strongly encourage players to wear braces, but many college players cannot wait to reach the professional level so they can shed their team-imposed restraints.

Most notable among this group is Cam Robinson, Alabama’ top lineman, a junior who has been coy about whether he will leave the university and declare himself eligible for the N.F.L. draft this spring. Asked about knee braces on Saturday, Robinson remained careful not to tip his hand about his plans, but he was abundantly clear about a particular decision he had already made.

“henever it happens,”e said, “ won’ be wearing those things anymore.”
